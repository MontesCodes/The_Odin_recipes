      <h1>Cooking Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a
          baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>
          Rinse the red snapper under cold water and pat it dry with paper
          towels. Make 3 to 4 diagonal slashes on each side of the fish. Rub the
          fish inside and out with olive oil, garlic, paprika, Cajun seasoning,
          salt, and black pepper. Stuff the cavity with lemon slices.
        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>
          Place the prepared red snapper on the baking sheet. Bake in the
          preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and
          flakes easily with a fork.
        </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>
          Remove the fish from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
          Garnish with fresh parsley and additional lemon slices if desired.
          Serve hot.
